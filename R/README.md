## Data Files

Resistance.csv: Results of bleaching model simulations and resistance calculations. For making Figure 3.

Robustness.csv: Results of the robustness analyses. For making figure 4 e-h

TEST_resistance_perms.csv - Resistance values for each simulation for testing the randomization statistics code
	
SwainSymbsR.csv: Swain et al. (2017) thermal tolerance ranks that are adapted for the symbiont node thermal tolerances. See Swain et al. (2017) for file description.
