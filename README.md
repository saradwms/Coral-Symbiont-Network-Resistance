## Additional Supplemental Material 

Code and data files needed to execute the code are re-organized and provided in this GitHub Repository. See the R and Python sub-folders.

## R
All R code was written in R version 3.5.1 using R studio. 

For visualizing the model results, statistics described in Appendix S2, and code for symbiont node tolerances:
	StatisticsAndVisualization_R35.rmd – Rmarkdown
	
## Python
All code for the network bleaching model, null network models, and robustness removal models was written in Python 2.7.16 using a jupyter notebook. 

For simulating the bleaching model (Eq. 1), calculating resistance, degree distribution fitting, the host-specific network, and the generalized network:
	BleachingModel_Resistance_Py27.ipynb – Jupyter notebook

For the removal models and robustness analyses:
	RemovalModels_Robustness_Py27.ipynb – Jupyter notebook
