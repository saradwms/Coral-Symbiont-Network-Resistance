# Resistance and robustness of the global coral-symbiont network
## Williams and Patterson, Ecology 2020



## Code

For simulating the bleaching model (Eq. 1), calculating resistance, degree distribution fitting, the host-specific network, and the generalized network:
	BleachingModel_Resistance_Py27.ipynb – Jupyter notebook

For the removal models and robustness analyses:
	RemovalModels_Robustness_Py27.ipynb – Jupyter notebook

## Data Files

In the 'Data' folder, you will find all of the nodes and edges csv's (as they are referenced in the code) that you need to make every network (every spatial scale). 'trial1.csv' is included as one iteration of the symbiont tolerances, run the r script to create 100 trialN files for running all 100 natural network simulations and also 100 rtrialN files for running all 100 shuffled tolerances network simulations.
